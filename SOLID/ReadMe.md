Single Responsibility Principle: Each class should have only one responsibility.
Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
Interface Segregation Principle: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
